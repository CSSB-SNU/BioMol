Installation
============

Python version support
----------------------

BioMol supports Python 3.10 and above.


Install with pip
----------------

BioMol can be installed directly from GitHub using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/CSSB-SNU/BioMol.git

.. Note::

   Currently, BioMol does not support PyPI installations because it's under active development.
   We plan to release it on PyPI once the API stabilizes.


Install from source
-------------------

BioMol can be installed from source using `pixi <https://pixi.sh/latest/>`_, a modern Python package manager.

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/CSSB-SNU/BioMol
   cd BioMol
   pixi install
