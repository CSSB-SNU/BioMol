BioMol is a molecular data engine that provides PyMOL-like selections and NumPy-style operations, designed for machine learning and large-scale molecular analysis.

For more details, see the [documentation](https://biomol.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

> [!WARNING]
> BioMol is under active development. The API may change without notice.

## Installation

BioMol supports Python 3.10 and above.

### Install from GitHub

BioMol can be installed directly from GitHub using pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/CSSB-SNU/BioMol.git
```

> [!Note]
> Currently, BioMol does not support PyPI installations because it's under active development. We plan to release it on PyPI once the API stabilizes.

### Install from Source

BioMol can be installed from source using [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/), a modern Python package manager.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CSSB-SNU/BioMol
cd BioMol
pixi install
```
